            My full name is Dev Jaykrishna Jogi. I was born in a city Ahmedabad located in eastern part of Gujarat, India. I completed my high school before i came here in Canada. 
            I am a joyful person but I take time to blend in with people who are new to me. I play a lot of sports such as Billiards, Cricket, Volleyball and Bowling.
            I have a lot of dreams and I had a lot of dreams in past which i can't fulfill but i never stopped dreaming. I want to be a good photographer and I want to open my own studio.

            I am a caring and sensitive person. I am doing part time job at a gas station and sometimes I take orders for photography. I recently covered a cricket tournament in Ottawa
            and it was fun. I am doing photography for almost half a decade. There are a lot of times a break and lose over something but i don't cry over it but instead I try to figure
            out where I went wrong and work over it. My recent motto is very simple "WHATVEVER IS GONNA HAPPEN, HAPPENS FOR SOMETHING GOOD." You don't know what god has planned for you so just smile 
            and move forward, God has greater plans. So, just live your life and do great things that's it.
